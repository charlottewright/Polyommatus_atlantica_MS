# Section 1: A chromosome-level genome for *P. atlantica* consists of 229 pairs of chromosomes.

[length_and_genes](<https://github.com/charlottewright/P_atlantica_genome/tree/main/1_genome/length_and_genes>)

Contains the code and data needed to generate the length and gene distribution histograms shown in Figure 1B and 1C. These are plotted using an R script (plot_merians_vs_repeat_density.R)

[repeat_landscape](<https://github.com/charlottewright/P_atlantica_genome/tree/main/1_genome/repeat_landscape>)

Contains the code and data needed to generate the repeat landscape plots for *P. atlantica* and *P. icarus* shown in Figure 1D. These are plotted using an R script (plot_repeat_divergence.R).

[Z_chr](<https://github.com/charlottewright/P_atlantica_genome/tree/main/1_genome/Z_chr>)

Contains the code and data needed to plot PacBio coverage and repeat density per scaffold, and along selected chromosomes, in the *P. atlantica* genome assembly shown in Figure S1A, S1B and S1C. Also contains the data needed to plot PacBio coverage along the chromosomes of *P. icarus* as shown in Figure S1D. These are plotted using an R script (plot_coverage_and_repeat_density.R)
